## Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Aspect Term Extraction (ATE)

This repository contains implementations for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Aspect Term Extraction (ATE) tasks using various word embeddings and recurrent neural network models.

### Folder Structure

- **Glove**
- **Word2Vec**
- **FastText**

Each of these folders contains Jupyter notebooks implementing three models: GRU, LSTM, and Vanilla RNN for each task namely Named Entity Recognition and Aspect Term Extraction.

### Datasets

The datasets for NER and ATE are located in the `data` folder.

### Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
  ```bash git clone <repository-url> ```
  ```cd <repository-name>```
